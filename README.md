### 👋 Hi there, I'm Akshay – Welcome to My Cybersecurity Space

🔐 I'm currently pursuing my MSc in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics.  
👨‍💻 I’m passionate about **automating security workflows** using Python and Linux.  
🧠 Currently diving into:
- Log analysis & security scripting
- SOC alert automation
- Building cybersecurity tools from scratch

💡 I enjoy solving real-world problems through automation and simplifying repetitive tasks in security operations.

### 🚀 Projects I'm Building
- 🔍 **Log Analyzer**: Detects failed login attempts from Linux auth logs using regex and Python.
- 🧠 **IP Reputation Checker**: Uses AbuseIPDB API to flag suspicious IPs found in logs.
- 📢 **SOC Alert Bot**: Monitors logs and sends alerts to Slack in real-time.

More coming soon... 👨‍🔬
