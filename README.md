### 👋 Hi there, I'm Akshay – Welcome to My Cybersecurity Space

🔐 I'm currently pursuing my MSc in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics.  
👨‍💻 I mainly work with Linux and Python, learning through hands-on labs, CTFs, and small security projects.
🧠 Currently diving into:
- SOC fundamentals: log analysis, alerting, basic incident handling  
- Pentesting basics: reconnaissance, scanning, common vulnerabilities  
- CTF practice (Linux, forensics, web) on TryHackMe  

---

### 🚀 Projects I'm Building
- 🔍 **Log Analyzer**: Detects failed login attempts from Linux auth logs using regex and Python.
- 🧠 **IP Reputation Checker**: Uses AbuseIPDB API to flag suspicious IPs found in logs.
- 📢 **SOC Alert Bot**: Monitors logs and sends alerts to Slack in real-time.

More coming soon... 👨‍🔬
